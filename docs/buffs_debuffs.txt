                        MY TURN - BUFFS & DEBUFFS GUIDE
================================================================================

================================================================================
                            TURN COUNTING SYSTEM
================================================================================

All buffs/debuffs use "Option A" turn counting:
- Effect is applied immediately when cast
- Effect expires at the END of the affected unit's next turn
- Default duration is 1 turn unless specified otherwise

Example (1 turn Stun):
  Turn 1: You use Stun on enemy Markswoman
          → Markswoman is Stunned
  Turn 2: Opponent's turn - Markswoman CANNOT act (stunned)
          → At END of opponent's turn, Stun expires
  Turn 3: Your turn
  Turn 4: Opponent's turn - Markswoman CAN act normally

================================================================================
                            TARGETING SYSTEM
================================================================================

- "target" in skill description = Player chooses the target
- No "target" keyword = Auto-targets front-most unit
  - Damage skills → front-most enemy
  - Healing skills → front-most ally (or lowest HP ally)

================================================================================
                                  BUFFS
================================================================================

SHIELD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Creates a protective barrier that absorbs damage before HP.
Duration: 1 turn OR until depleted (whichever comes first)
Stacking: Yes (shield values stack)

How it works:
- When a unit with Shield takes damage, the Shield absorbs it first
- Remaining damage (if any) is dealt to HP
- Shield does not regenerate naturally
- Shield expires at end of unit's turn if not depleted

Example:
  Unit has 100 HP and 30 Shield
  Takes 50 damage
  → Shield absorbs 30, HP takes 20
  → Result: 80 HP, 0 Shield

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TAUNT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Forces opponent's normal attacks to target this unit.
Duration: 1 turn (default)
Stacking: No (only one unit can have Taunt active)

How it works:
- When a unit has Taunt, enemy normal attacks MUST target this unit
- Acts as if this unit is always the "front" unit for targeting
- Skill cards that say "target" can still choose other targets
- Only affects auto-target attacks (not skills with "target")

Example:
  Makash (Position 4) has Taunt
  Enemy tries to attack Squire (Position 1)
  → Attack is redirected to Makash instead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EMPOWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Increases all damage dealt by 50%.
Duration: 1 turn (default)
Stacking: No (refreshes duration)

How it works:
- All attack damage from this unit is multiplied by 1.5
- Applies to both normal attacks and skill cards
- Calculated after ATK multiplier

Damage Formula with Empower:
  Final Damage = Base ATK × Card Multiplier × 1.5

Example:
  Hero with 10 ATK + Empower uses 100% ATK card
  → 10 × 1.0 × 1.5 = 15 damage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REGENERATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Heals the unit over time.
Duration: 1 turn (default, unless specified)
Stacking: No (refreshes duration)

How it works:
- Heals (50% ATK) of the caster at the start of the unit's turn
- ATK used is from the unit who applied the regeneration
- Healing happens before the unit takes their action

Example:
  Priest (10 ATK) applies Regeneration to Squire
  → At start of Squire's turn, Squire heals 5 HP (50% of 10)

                                 DEBUFFS
================================================================================

STUN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Target cannot make a move on the next turn.
Duration: 1 turn
Stacking: No (refreshes duration)
Applied by: Squire's EX Skill (Guardian's Oath)

How it works:
- Stunned hero cannot use any cards or EX skill
- Player cannot play any of that hero's cards from hand
- Stun wears off at the start of the stunned hero's next turn
- Does not prevent the hero from being targeted by allies

Example:
  Squire uses Guardian's Oath on Enemy Markswoman
  → Markswoman takes 20 damage and is Stunned
  → Next turn, opponent cannot play Markswoman's cards or EX skill

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WEAK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Reduces all damage dealt by 50%.
Duration: 1 turn (or as specified)
Stacking: No (refreshes duration)

How it works:
- All attack damage from this unit is multiplied by 0.5
- Applies to both normal attacks and skill cards
- Calculated after ATK multiplier

Damage Formula with Weak:
  Final Damage = Base ATK × Card Multiplier × 0.5

Example:
  Hero with 10 ATK + Weak uses 100% ATK card
  → 10 × 1.0 × 0.5 = 5 damage

================================================================================
                            SPECIAL MECHANICS
================================================================================

PENETRATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Attack hits the primary target AND the hero directly behind them.
Applied by: Makash's EX Skill (Fallen Strike)

How it works:
- Deals damage to the targeted enemy
- Also deals the same damage to the enemy behind the target
- If the target is in the back position, only hits that target
- Any status effects (like Weak) are applied to BOTH targets

Example:
  Makash uses Fallen Strike on Enemy Position 1
  → Enemy 1 takes 20 damage + Weak
  → Enemy 2 takes 20 damage + Weak

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FRONT ENEMY (Auto-Target)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Automatically targets the front-most living enemy.
Applied by: Makash's Killing Chop

How it works:
- No target selection needed
- Always hits the enemy in Position 1
- If Position 1 is dead, hits Position 2, etc.
- Respects Taunt (if enemy has Taunt, hits that unit instead)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UPGRADE & SHUFFLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Permanently upgrades the card and shuffles it back into the deck.
Applied by: Makash's War Stomp

How it works:
- After playing the card, it gains bonus stats
- War Stomp: +20% ATK multiplier per use
- Card is shuffled back into the deck (not discarded)
- Upgrades persist for the entire battle

Example:
  Play War Stomp (50% ATK) → deals damage, gains Taunt
  → Card becomes 70% ATK and shuffles into deck
  Play again → deals more damage
  → Card becomes 90% ATK and shuffles into deck

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
                          BUFF/DEBUFF INTERACTIONS
================================================================================

EMPOWER + WEAK
- If a unit has both Empower and Weak, they cancel out (1.5 × 0.5 = 0.75)
- Net result: 25% damage reduction

MULTIPLE BUFFS
- Shield stacks additively (10 Shield + 15 Shield = 25 Shield)
- Taunt does not stack (only one Taunt active at a time)
- Empower does not stack (refreshes duration)

BUFF REMOVAL
- Currently no cards remove buffs/debuffs
- Buffs/debuffs expire based on their duration
- Death removes all buffs/debuffs from that unit

================================================================================

POISON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Deals damage each time the hero makes an action.
Duration: Until cleansed or hero dies
Stacking: No (refreshes)

How it works:
- Deals (50% ATK) damage of the caster each time the poisoned hero plays a card
- Damage triggers AFTER the card is played
- Does not trigger on EX skills

Example:
  Makash (10 ATK) poisons enemy Priest
  → Priest plays Heal card
  → After Heal resolves, Priest takes 5 damage (50% of 10)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BURN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Deals damage at the end of each player's turn.
Duration: Until cleansed or hero dies
Stacking: YES (burn damage stacks additively)

How it works:
- Deals burn damage at the END of each player's turn
- Multiple burn applications ADD together
- Burn damage is fixed (not ATK-based)

Example:
  Hero has 10 Burn stacks
  → At end of Player 1's turn: takes 10 damage
  → At end of Player 2's turn: takes 10 damage
  → If another 5 Burn is applied: now has 15 Burn stacks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FREEZE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Increases card cost for the affected hero.
Duration: 1 turn (default)
Stacking: YES (up to 3 stacks)

How it works:
- Each stack of Freeze increases that hero's card costs by +1 mana
- Maximum 3 stacks
- Affects all cards from that hero in hand

Example:
  Markswoman has 2 Freeze stacks
  → Aimed Shot normally costs 3 mana, now costs 5 mana
  → Focus normally costs 2 mana, now costs 4 mana
